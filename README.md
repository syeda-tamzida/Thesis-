# Thesis
This project predicts the corrosion percentage in reinforced concrete by extracting surface roughness from images using Sobel edge detection and combining it with Concrete Resistivity and Half-Cell Potential. A Random Forest Regressor model is trained to assess corrosion for structural health monitoring and predictive maintenance.
